# Code_Refactor

## Background
This is the first homework assignment for the UofT Bootcamp.  Below is the story and acceptance criteria for reference.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Process and Changes

* I started out by looking at the page to get an understanding of the flow and compared that to the HTML file.
* After that I started cleaning up code from top to bottom on the HTML to meet the acceptance criteria.
* Next I tested the operation of the page and fixed anything that was broken.
* Finally I reviewed the css file and made changes so that it match the flow of the HTML file and double checked the operation of the page.
